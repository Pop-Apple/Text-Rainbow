## Text Rainbow

Regularly varying **RGB values**.  
Form shines in rainbow colors (LOL)  
Since the **`Timer`** is running at high speed  
It may be very slow in some cases.  

## contrivance ðŸ¤”

Convert the value of NumericUpDown to **Convert.ToInt32**  
Assign it to the BackColor of the Form as a color HTML code  
Since `if` did not detect the value  
Use `try` `catch` to return an error when  
Calculate the sum and difference of NumericUpDown values  
Timer is used to perform these operations. 
```
Other resource items are hidden on the Form.  
```
